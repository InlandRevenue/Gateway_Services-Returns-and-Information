# Return Status Push Notifications Service 

The Return Status Push Notification file is intended to be used by software providers where large quantities of return status data is required. 

The Return Status Push Notification is based around a file transfer solution, where Inland Revenue will send information via SFTP to the software provider on a daily (overnight) basis in the evening of each business day.
